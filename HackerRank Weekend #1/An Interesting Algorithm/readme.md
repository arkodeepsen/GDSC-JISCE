Suppose there is an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer N and divides it by two, if it is even. If it is odd then it is multiplied by three and one is added. For example, the sequence for N=5 is as follows: multiply by three and add one. (16)

5->16->8->4->2->1

Input Format

5

Constraints

1≤n≤10^6
